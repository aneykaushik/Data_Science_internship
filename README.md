# Data_Science_internship
In this repository , I'll show my data science virtual internship experience . It's contain everything like technology ,coding ,presentation pdf and certificate 

The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks
1.Web scraping to gain company insights
2.Predicting customer buying behaviour

Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from Skytrax.

Following insights were uncovered as they are summed up in the one slide presentation.

Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behaviour

Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This task involves building a high quality predictive to predict the successful bookings using customer bookings data
